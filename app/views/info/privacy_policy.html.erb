        <h2>My Fair Election Privacy Statement</h2>
        <em class="light">Effective: October 15, 2012</em><br />
        <br />
        <h4>Scope</h4>
        This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to My Fair Election, but to<br />
        make this notice easier to read we will use the term "our Web site".<br />
        <br />
        Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. My Fair Election is not<br />
        responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this Notice does<br />
        not apply to those Web sites.<br />
        <br />
        <h4>Application of This Notice</h4>
        This Notice applies only to the information collected by My Fair Election from the users of<br />
        our Web site. It does not apply to information collected by My Fair Election in any other way,<br />
        including offline.<br />
        <br />
        <h4>The Information We Collect</h4>
        Our Web site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each<br />
        visitor to our Web site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not email addresses.<br />
        For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names,<br />
        addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular<br />
        visitors to our Web site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical<br />
        support staff.<br />
        <br />
        Our Web site does track certain information about the visits to our Web site. For example,<br />
        we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web site and its<br />
        individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web site. Those<br />
        aggregated statistics may also be provided to third parties, but again, the statistics contain no<br />
        personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.<br />
        <br />
        We will also request your name and email address so we can communicate with you 1) to<br />
        establish your account 2) to remind you to vote and 3) to solicit your review of your polling<br />
        place if you forget to login on election day. We may also communicate with you, if requested,<br />
        for the purposes of customer support. We request your mailing address so we can determine<br />
        your polling place, and properly record your feedback.<br />
        <br />
        <h4>How We Use Information: My Fair Election Only Uses Your Personal Information for Specific Purposes</h4>
        The personal information you provide to us when using our Web site, such as your name, postal<br />
        address, and email address will be kept confidential and used only as described above. We will<br />
        not use your personal information for any other purpose, or share it with third parties except in<br />
        connection with locating election information for you (for example to the Google polling place<br />
        API). The information shared with third parties is always the least needed to gain the needed<br />
        results, and we will not provide your address in combination with your email or physical address.<br />
        <br />
        <h4>Our Commitment to Data Security</h4>
        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of<br />
        information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to<br />
        safeguard and secure the information we collect online.<br />
        <br />
        <h4>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h4>
